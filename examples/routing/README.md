# Tyrian routing with Url-DSL

This is an example of how to do routing in Tyrian using third party library [url-dsl](https://github.com/sherpal/url-dsl).  You should also add [scala-js-dom](https://github.com/scala-js/scala-js-dom) to your list of dependencies in order to get access to `dom.window.location.href` property. 

To run the program in a browser you will need to have yarn (or npm) installed.

On first run:

```sh
yarn install
```

and from then on

```sh
yarn start
```

Then navigate to [http://localhost:1234/](http://localhost:1234/)
