# Tyrian routing example

This is an example of how to do routing in Tyrian using 3rd party library [https://github.com/sherpal/url-dsl](url-dsl). 
You should also add [https://github.com/scala-js/scala-js-dom](scala-js-dom) to your list of dependencies in order 
to get access to `dom.window.location.href` property.
